    <h1>Rowing: History and Facts</h1>
    <h2>How rowing became a sport</h2>
    <p>Rowing has been in existence for thousands of years. Before it was considered a competitive sport, it was a way of transportation for people of many cultures and locations across the world. According to World Rowing, the first rowing shell was discovered in Finland and dates back to 5,800 BCE. The first race was held in Venice in 1284, and the first race with rowing shells as we know them today was the Boat Race between Oxford and Cambridge University, on the River Thames in England, in 1829. Soon after, in 1839, the first Henley Royal Regatta was held in Henley-on-the-Thames, England. To this day, this is a widely celebrated event of utmost prestige and tradition in the rowing world. Soon after, it became a core collegiate sport in the United States. Many top university rowing programs today were established in the mid to late 1800s. Men’s rowing became an Olympic sport in 1900, while women’s rowing entered the games in 1974.

    In terms of shells, initially, the oarsman would be stationary in his seat and create movement through the swinging of his upper body. Then the legs were incorporated into the rowing stroke, and the seat turned into a greased rag that one would sit on and slide back and forth on propelling the rowing blade with the driving of the legs. Then came the invention of the rolling seat. It was a wooden seat with wheels. This revolutionized the sport of rowing and is still used today.

    Overall, rowing has been a tradition whether in the form of transportation or sport for a long time. Today, it is considered one of the most challenging cardiovascular sports. It is ever-expanding across the United States, and very prominent in countries across Europe and Oceania.

    <h2>The Different Boat Classes:</h2>
    <p>Rowing has evolved into two different styles. One is sculling, where the rower is rowing with two blades. The other is sweep, where one only rows with one oar. Below are listed the many and most common boats that can be rowed within these categories:</p>
    <h3>Sculling</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1x (Single) – One person in the shell</li>
        <li>2x (Double) – 2 people in the shell</li>
        <li>4x (Quad) – 4 people in a shell</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Sweep</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2- (Pair) – 2 people in shell</li>
        <li>4- (Straight Four) – 4 people in shell without coxswain</li>
        <li>4+ (Coxed Four) – 4 people in shell with coxswain.</li>
        <li>8+ (Eight) – 8 people in shell with coxswain.</li>
