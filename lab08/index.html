    <main><h1>Alexander Dawallu's Biography</h1>
    <p><strong>My name is Alexander Dawallu,</strong> and I am from Boulder, Colorado. I am an economics major, and am interested in this topic as I like social studies, geography, the grand scheme of how the world works, the right balance of math.</p>
    <p>In terms of achievements, I was recruited to row on the rowing team, was captain of my high school team, and am currently on the Syracuse Rowing Leadership Council.</p>
    <h2>Personal Information</h2>
    <p>I row, enjoy playing and listening to music, art, and getting outside in nature. My favorite movie is the Secret Life of Walter Mitty as it never gets old when I rewatch it.</p>
    <p>I also speak German as my father is from Germany, and we visit my grandmother there every summer. Hopefully I can use this to my advantage as I would eventually like to either study or work abroad.</p>
