        <ul>
          <li><strong>Garmin Vivoactive 4: </strong> 
            Most fitness watches track rowing, however, this watch offers a fairly extensive range of activities, is lightweight, and is in the mid-range in terms of price. It will help you track progress and heart rate which is essential, especially if you are training on your own.
            </li>
          <li><strong>Oakley Sutro Sunglasses: </strong>
            <br>Can’t think of what kind of glasses you want to protect yourself from the glare on the water, but also want to look fast? The Sutros will be your best bet. Not only are they lightweight and wearable, but they have many color options that can add another element of style and personality to your kit.
            </li>
          <li><strong>776 BC Uni: </strong>
          This new brand of uniforms fits to any kind of rower very comfortably. Although these unis tend to be on the more pricy side, it is worth the investment as they will offer a top of the line experience.
            </li>
          <li><strong>Foam Roller: </strong>
            No specific brand name for this one. Any foam roller should do the trick. This an item you definitely will want in your rehab kit. </li>
          <li><strong>Lululemon Bucket Hat: </strong>
            Any bucket hat can be a fun way to keep your head cool. However, we picked this product in particular as it is durable, flexible, and can fit to various head shapes.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <div class="secondrow">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Polar H10 Heart Rate Monitor: </strong>
          When you are trying to gain fitness, steady state is often your best option. Therefore, to ensure you are in the correct heart rate zone, a heart rate strap is very helpful.
          </li>
        <li><strong>Strava: </strong>
          While they offer a premium subscription to this app, the original version is free with many features that are helpful to training. The simple act of posting your workouts to a following will help you stay motivated and on track with your training as well.
          </li>
        <li><strong>NK Stroke Coach: </strong>
          This is a very useful piece of equipment if you row in small or coxless boats. However, this can be a pricy investment and should only be considered if you are rowing in these boats.
          </li>
        <li><strong>Nike Compression Shirt: </strong>
          As the weather becomes cooler, this is a great piece of clothing to wear as it keeps you warm but not too warm. It is also a great way to style your rowing fit.
